<h1>Duong ƒêinh</h1>
<p> I am currently a postdoc at Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in Bonn, Germany. </p>

<p>
I completed my PhD in Mathematics (2023) and Master in Mathematical Physics (2019) at University of <br>
Hamburg, under supervision of J. Teschner. Before that, I completed a dual bachelor degree in Math and <br>
Physics at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) in 2017.

<h3>Research interests</h3>
<p>
I am broadly interested in the interface of geometry and physics. </p>

<p> My research often revolves around the moduli spaces of Higgs bundles and holomorphic/projective <br>
connections on Riemann surfaces, in particular the integrable structure and stratification on these moduli <br>
spaces. My motivation, in addition, comes from the approaches to the geometric Langlands program using <br>
techniques from conformal field theories, such as the one pioneered by Beilinson-Drinfeld in which the <br>
quantization of the moduli of Higgs bundles plays a key role. </p>

<p>Recently, I am also interested in random geometry, as well as its relation to enumerative geometry and <br> 
conformal field theories.
