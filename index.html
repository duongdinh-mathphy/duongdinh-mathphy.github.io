<h1>Duong ƒêinh</h1>
<p> I am currently a postdoc at Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in Bonn, Germany. </p>

<p>
I completed my PhD in Mathematics (2023) and Master in Mathematical Physics (2019) at University of <br>
Hamburg, under supervision of J. Teschner. Before that, I completed a dual bachelor degree in Math and <br>
Physics at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) in 2017.

<h3>Research interests</h3>
<p>
I am broadly interested in the interface of geometry and physics. </p>

<p>
I am interested in making explicit certain aspects of two early approaches to the geometric Langlands <br> 
correspondence: the first one by Drinfeld using Radon transform and the second by Beilinson-Drinfeld using <br> 
conformal field theories techniques. The moduli of Higgs bundles with its integrable structure provided by <br>
the Hitchin fibration plays a key role in these formulations. The recent development in analytic geometric <br>
Langlands often lurks behind as motivation for having a more explicit understanding of these early approaches. <br>
</p>

<p>
I am also interested in the inherent geometric aspects of the moduli of Higgs bundles and related ones, such <br>
as moduli of flat/projective connections on Riemann surfaces. Conformal limits, natural stratification and <br> 
deformation of symplectic structures on these moduli spaces are the usual ingredients I work with.
</p>

<p>
Recently, I have also developed interests in:
<ul>
<li> Donagi-Pantev-Simpson's approach to geometric Langlands and its relation to Drinfeld's approach;
<li> Bridgeland's spaces of stability conditions and his complexification of moduli of Higgs bundles;
<li> the interaction between random geometry (e.g. Schramm-Loewner evolution), real enumerative geometry <br> 
and conformal field theories;
<li> a geometric understanding of the Verlinde formula.
</ul>
</p>
