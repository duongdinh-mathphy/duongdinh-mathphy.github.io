<p>I'm currently a postdoc scholar at Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in Bonn, Germany. </p>
<p>I completed my PhD in 2023 from the University of Hamburg, under supervision of Jörg Teschner. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I am broadly interested in the interface of math and physics. My more specific interests often </p>
<p>revolve around the geometry of moduli spaces of Higgs bundles and holomorphic connections on Riemann </p>
<p>surfaces. The motivation often comes from the approaches to the geometric Langlands program using </p>
<p>techniques from conformal field theories, such as the one pioneered by Beilinson-Drinfeld in which </p>
<p>the quantization of the moduli of Higgs bundles plays a key role. </p>
