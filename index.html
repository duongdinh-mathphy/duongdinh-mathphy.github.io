<h1>Duong ƒêinh</h1>
<p>I am currently a postdoc scholar at Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in Bonn, Germany.  </p>

<p>
I completed my PhD in Mathematics (2023) and Master in Mathematical Physics (2019) at University of <br>
Hamburg, under supervision of J. Teschner. Before that, I completed a dual bachelor degree in Math and <br>
Physics at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) in 2017.

<h3>Research interests</h3>
<p>
I am broadly interested in the interface of math and physics. My more specific interests often <br>
revolve around the geometry of moduli spaces of Higgs bundles and holomorphic connections on Riemann <br>
surfaces. The motivation often comes from the approaches to the geometric Langlands program using <br>
techniques from conformal field theories, such as the one pioneered by Beilinson-Drinfeld in which <br>
the quantization of the moduli of Higgs bundles plays a key role. </p>

<p>Recently, I am also interested in random geometry and its relation to conformal field theories.
